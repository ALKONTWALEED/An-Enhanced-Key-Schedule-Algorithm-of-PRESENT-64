# An-Enhanced-Key-Schedule-Algorithm-of-PRESENT-64
This project implements a modified version of the key schedule algorithm for the lightweight PRESENT-64 block cipher. The aim is to enhance the diffusion and randomness of round keys while keeping the algorithm efficient and suitable for resource-constrained devices.
